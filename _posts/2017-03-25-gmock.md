### EXPECT_CALL

#### Prototype

    EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, method(matchers))
               .Times(cardinality)
               .WillOnce(action)
               .WillRepetedly(action)


#### Arguments

* `matchers` an actual argument, a predefined matcher, or '_' if not interested
* `cardinality` a predefined fuzzy cardinality(e.g. "AtLeast()"), or an actual number (incl. 0).
* `action` there are following cases

    1. Return type of `method` if built-in type or pointer or default-constructable type(since C++11), use the `default action` (e.g. for void function just return, for bool function return false)
    2. Use predefined functions

#### Methods

* `Times()` optional methods, if not specified following rule is evaluated to determine its cardinality:

    1. If no `WillOnce()` nor `WillRepetedly()` is specified, cardinality is 1
    2. If exist n(n >= 1) `WillOnce()` but no `WillRepetedly()`, cardinality is n
    3. If exist n(n >= 0) `WillOnce()` and one `WillRepetedly()`, cardinality is AtLeast(n)

#### Order
 
* Multiple rules for one method

    If there are multiple `EXPECT_CALL` defined in one test case for the same `method`, then the matching order is **reverse** (the new rule override the old). This allows user to define general expectations in test fixture and override some dedicated rules later in the test case.

* Multiple rules for different method

    By default, the definition order doesn't affect the evaluation order, in other word there is no strict evaluation order. However, if you want to specify strict order, define an `InSequence` object. If you want relative order, check the [CookBook](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock/docs/CookBook.md).

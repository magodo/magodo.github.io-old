I'm writing this post in English is because I'm typing via SSH without X11-forwarding, so no way to use input method(Chinese).

Last night, I was partially sitting at bed, leaning my back on a cusion, putting the laptop computer on my laptop. I lowered my head and reading something on the screen. I was doing this at most 3 minutes and then felt a pain fading into my back. I tired to sit down and stretch my arms a bit but it doesn't help a lot. Then I realized that it wasn't my back causing this hurt, but my neck, the **cervical vertebra**.

I just listened to a podcast talking about **cervical vertebra**. I learned that it always reuslts into other places of your body hurt, sometimes it will also make people hard to breath or dizzy. I have known I should take care of my vertebra since then, but never thought it will happens on my own body so quickly.

This morning I went to hospital to consult. From the X pic, the doctor got the following verdict:

>>> cervical vertebra slightly degenerates, accompany with the physiological curve becomes straight!

That's just like a thunder hit me. I read something from [here](https://www.zhihu.com/question/19562063) that the "degeneration" is a non-reversible process. Straighting of the vertebra is the first step of this degeneration, and it will become more awful!

The doctor tells little, only giving me a list of medicine and warning me if I don't adjust my habits, the sympton would get worse and I have to be performed an operation then. That's all.

"Damn, What an awful experience seeing a doctor in hospital!", I'm moaning to myself. 

Frankly speaking, I was so nervous last night, and I submitted a question in _ZhiHu_, hoping some one would be so kind to give me a detailed answer because I don't think I am the only one encountered this case. Hopefully, there is one user gives me a thorough verdict(100 times better than the doctor gave me). You can find it here: [ZhiHu_Qusetion](https://www.zhihu.com/question/46571757?from=profile_question_card)

Now I determine that I have to something to save my vertebra. I think the root cause why I suffers this time is mostly becaue I always play IPad/laptop in sofa/bed, lowering my head and keeping for to long duration. The best posture for vertebra is lying on bed and putting the head on a good-shaped pillow. But how can I play IPad/laptop in that situation?

Then I remember that I read some posts somewhere that just a box(any kind, only need to be large enough) could fulfill my requirement. I happen to have some such boxes by hand. So I start to making that box into a _stuff_(don't know if it could be named as a tool) looks like below:

![box](/images/vertebra/IMG_3079.JPG)

Let's just call it **box**! The window on the left side is my first try for touching IPad, but it is not so user friendly. Therefore, I cut another window in the front facet, it is much better and practical.

With **box** I can read documents/web page when lying on bed, of course I can also play _HearthStone_. But it is mainly for entertainment, how can I do something else, e.g. coding or writing post like this when I am lying on bed? The answer is, you need to have two things:

1. An IPad application for SSH to your laptop
2. A bluetooth keyboard

Again, I happen to have them by hand, I have installed a free application named _serverauditor_. If you have spare money, I heard that another app called _Prompt_ is more powerful. But currently _serverauditor_ is enough for me except it doesn't support X-11 forwarding. On the other hand, my girl friend has bought me a bluetooth keyboard: _FilcoMinila-air_. This keyboard supports some short-key for IOS, like:

* cmd + backspace: one can minimize current session and switch between "search bar" and "desktop", in which case I can switch between applications(before the one in background is dead)

Now I can open my laptop, entering **box**, putting the keyboard on my stomach. SSH to the laptop from IPad and typing this post(except the pictures of course)!

At last, I want to tell everyone who is reading this post here, don't keep your head lowering, save your vertebra!

# Operator + Motion/Text Object 

Prefer to `operator + motion/object` over `v{motion}{operator}`!

`operators` and `motion`/`text object` are __orthogonal__, so:

* Once you learn a new `motion`/`text object`,
  You can do edit on various portions of text with `operators` you learned.

* Once you learn a new `operator`,
  You can do new kind of edit with various `motion`/`text object` you learned.

## Motion Reference

`t`: jump up to a character

`f`: jump onto a character

`;`: go to the next instance when you've jumped to a character

`,`: go to the previous instance when you've jumped to a character

`}`: go to next paragraph

`{`: go to previous paragraph


## Text Objects References

Below:

* `i` means "inside"
* `a` means "around" (which counts the spaces arounded)

`words`: `iw` and `aw`

`sentences`: `is` and `as`

`paragraphs`: `ip` and `ap`

`single quotes`: `i'` and `a'`

`double quotes`: `i"` and `a"`

`back ticks`: `i\`` and `a\``

`parenthesis`: `i(` and `a(`

`brackets`: `i[` and `a[`

`braces`: `i{` and `a{`

`tags`: `it` and `at`

# Repeating Actions

## "." (dot) Operator

Many tasks you do will make a lot of sense to repeat. Going into insert mode and adding some text, for example. You can do it once and then just move around and add it again with just the `.`. Here are a couple of other examples:

\# delete a word

    dw


\# delete five more words

    5.

Note about __Visual Mode__: If you want to perform `.` operator in Visual Mode, you need to execute: `:normal.` on a visual selection, which will temporarily switch you into Normal Mode. Another way is to add following line in `.vimrc`:
    
    vnoremap . :normal.<CR>

## Macro

Note about __Visual Mode__: If you want to perform macro(e.g. @a) in Visual Mode, you have to execute `:norm@a` on a visual selection, which will temporarily switch you into Normal Mode.

Hey guys, I'm just back from `Continental` 2016 anual dinner. My friends and I performed a wonderful dancing show: `uptown funk`! It's awesome, hope every one enjoyed it!

My new year wishes for working in `Continental` is:

* I can have a perfect transition from SI to DEV;

* I can write code with no bug;

* Even if my code has bug, it will finally be converted to __feature__!
